Hello, my name is Milton Mazzarri (a.k.a. `milmazz`). I’m a Systems Engineer and
an enthusiast of the Free/Libre Open Source Software philosophy.

Some years ago, I left my homeland (Venezuela) and began exploring other
opportunities worldwide. I lived for some years in Mexico, and now I work in
the United States of America.

You can check my [LinkedIn][] and [Github][] accounts if you want to know about what
I’m working on.

Among the things that I like the most are reading science-fiction or technical
books, sharing some time with friends, playing tennis, going for a bike ride,
playing football, or just running near home. Of course, I’m also passionate about
Computer Science and Programming Languages.

I will share through this blog my experiences as a programmer and write about a
variety of topics about different technologies. I was a system administrator in
the past, so maybe I’ll include some articles about that as well.

If you prefer, you can contact me at `me at milmazz.uno` or you can follow me on
Twitter at [@milmazz][]
